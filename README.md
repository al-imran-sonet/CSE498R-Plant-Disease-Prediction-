# CSE498R-Plant-Disease-Prediction-
This my Final year thesis Project . Working on Transformar models , making something Effeciant.  I colect image dataset which is small or already augmented . Then I marge the pure image( no augmentation ) then i augment that and make a 147k dataset .

We will apply 10 models 
1. XCiT 
2. DeiT 
3. ViT 
4. PVT v2 
5. PiT 
6. CAFormer  
7. BeiT  
8. RepViT
9. DaViT
10. M-ViTz
11. Customized CNN model (Low parameter <5M) with transfer Learning(TL)
CerevianNet: Parameter Efficient Multiclass Brain Tumor Classification Using Custom Lightweight CNN..


## How to use the project 
1. Version 01 folder contains codes of all Transformer models. You can see the best model and model history in spacific folders.
2. Version 02 folder contains CNN based custom model which is very light weight and performence is almost similar but lot more light weight.
3. Gradcam folder contains the Explanable AI and it can show how much accurate our coustom model is.


We submit our findings in a form of Publication in Plos Journal . Excited to see the review !!!
